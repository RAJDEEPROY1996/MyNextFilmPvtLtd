Project Summary -
    -> owner will upload a file {one pager, story, script, narration, etc}. 
    -> This file will get uploaded into IPFS {a decentralized storage}.   
    -> IPFS will return a CID {Content IDentifier} where the files are stored in the IPFS
    -> CID will be encrypt using AES encryption algorithm
    -> Key is used to point the CID. Key is created using encrypted email, encrypted file name, timestamp {= time of upload of file into IPFS. Time Format is epoch unix time}
    -> Encrypted email and encrypted file name is created using one-way encryption {keccak256 has been used}
    -> To retrieve the information, owner needs to provide Email, file name and time of upload of file into IPFS.
